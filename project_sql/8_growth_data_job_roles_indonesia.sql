üîç Key Findings:

üìå Growth Rate of Job Postings Per Role
- **Data Analyst** grew **152.27%** from Q3 (88) to Q4 (222).
- **Software Engineer** saw a **293.18%** increase from Q3 (44) to Q4 (173).
- **Data Engineer** rose by **52.44%** from Q3 (225) to Q4 (343).
- **Cloud Engineer** had the highest percentage growth (**285.71%**), from Q3 (14) to Q4 (54).

üìå Seasonal Hiring Patterns
- **Q4 consistently shows the highest hiring spike** across most roles.
- **Q2 tends to have the lowest number of postings**.

üìå Emerging vs. Established Roles
- **High-demand roles**: Data Engineer, Data Scientist, and Data Analyst show **stable demand**.
- **Emerging roles**: Machine Learning Engineer and Cloud Engineer have **lower job postings** but show **sharp growth in Q4**, suggesting they are gaining traction.

üìå Junior vs. Senior Role Growth
- **Junior and mid-level roles** see much faster growth than Senior Data Analyst, Senior Data Engineer, and Senior Data Scientist roles.
- This suggests companies are prioritizing **hiring entry-level and mid-level talent** rather than focusing on experienced professionals.
